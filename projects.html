      <p>Frontend made with React Native and backend with Google Firebase.</p>
      <p>
        Here is a video demo from the mobile app I made for myself. I still use
        this app multiple times a week to save my workouts and monitor my
        progression. It offers some statistics and possibility to search,
        filter, modify and delete saved workouts.

      <p>Frontend made with Django and backend with Google Firebase.</p>
      <p>
        This is a web frontend for my mobile app. It is very simplified and does not offer all the same features as mobile app.
        Although one nice feature in this app is that I can export my workouts to a .csv- file. 
        This app was actually running in production on this same server and domain before this site.

      <p>
        Site is running on a Linux server. I Installed Apache2, UFW and SSL sertificate to a server and now the site is running quite nicely.
        Made this site to show more details, like video demos and screenshots about the projects I have made. So here you can find the source code for this website you are on now.

      <h1 id="wordpress">WordPress sites for clients</h1>
      <p>Made with WordPress.</p>
      <p>
        In the beginning of my studies in 2019 I made two websites for an actual clients. One for entrepreneur and one for registered association.
        Websites are both still active and entrepreneur is still making a living out of her company so I guess the projects went well.
        Clients might have altered the original sites a little bit because I trained them to update and add content by themselves.
